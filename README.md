# CryptoBark
CryptoBark is a brand-new competitor in the field of cryptography. Developed by Dr Gutboi, the new barkryption protocol has been shown to be unbreakable by modern cryptanalysis. And although it is still being tested, CryptoBark is theorized to be the first cryptogrpahic algorithm to be able to withstand quantum computing attacks.

Unfortunately due to budget limitations at TREET Institutes, CryptoBark currently only functions with simple, lowercase messages, and is provided primarily as a proof of concept.

Update 2.0: CryptoBark now includes upper case functionality as well as number and punctuation support.
